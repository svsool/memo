# Getting started

This help can be read using any Markdown reader. For instance, GitHub UI, however, don't expect links to work and images to be correctly embedded, and instead, it's recommended to open this help folder using VSCode and Memo.

Memo is a markdown knowledge base with bidirectional links built on top of [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

One of the main things that Memo enables is creating links in the Markdown files. You can create links that refer to the same note, such as this one [[README|Start here]] or refer to any other [[Note]]. Use (cmd or ctrl) + click on the [[Note]] to create a new note to the disk on the fly.

Memo supports everything that VSCode Markdown plugin does and many other Markdown plugins from the marketplace. There are [a lot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=tag%3Amarkdown&target=VSCode&category=All%20categories&sortBy=Relevance) of plugins to choose from ðŸ™‚. Enjoy discovering those that suits your writing practices most!

I myself do prefer using Memo as a diary and adopted the following structure:

As you probably noticed, I use `yyyy-mm-dd ` format for naming my daily notes, which makes it easier to refer to certain dates or days throughout my diary. I'm planning to add dates highlight to the editor so that whenever you refer to date via the link for instance [[2020-07-05]] Memo will also provide a hint what day and month it is in a human-readable way.

Markdown is a well-known language for its flexibility, especially when it comes to writing and making notes, so you are free to choose your own and unique style of managing a personal knowledge base.

This is pretty much it to start using Memo, and if you want to read more on what Memo can do for you, feel free to continue to [[Features]] and [[How to]].
